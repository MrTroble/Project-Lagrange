<h3>Libraries</h3>

I am using [LunarG's Vulkan-SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).<br>
Current built version: <strong>1.1.82.0</strong><br>
Current Vulkan API version: <strong>1.1</strong>

<br>
Autodesk [FBX SDK](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2019-0)<br>

<br>
For image loading and font loading is [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) currently being used.<br>
This is planned to be replaced in the future.

The file library [TGVL](https://github.com/Troblecodings/TGVertex) is needed to compile newer versions of the TGEngine
